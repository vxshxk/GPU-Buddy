![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b44ccfd-9679-4f0d-a81f-27d97018f98b)

GPU-Buddy is a client-server C++ application designed to enable **remote GPU sharing** among multiple clients via **gRPC**. It leverages **NVIDIA‚Äôs Multi-Process Service (MPS)** to allow efficient, concurrent execution of GPU-intensive tasks.

---
## üìå Project Statement

To develop a client-server architecture that allows **multiple clients to share GPU resources remotely**, enabling efficient execution of parallel tasks using **GPU virtualization** and **gRPC-based communication**.

## üìö Background

Remote GPU access is essential for compute-heavy tasks like machine learning and data analytics. Existing platforms (e.g., Google Colab) are limited in scope. This project implements **NVIDIA MPS**, which enables multiple CUDA processes to **cooperatively** share GPU resources, reducing context-switching and improving utilization.
